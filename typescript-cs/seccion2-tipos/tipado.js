var numero = 5 //shouldn't be used, typescript automatically makes vars 

let nombre = "yo" //variable variable, you can modify its value later
const edad = 37 //value cant be modified, as a constant should work

nombre = 25 //the thing with js is that you can use the same variable for different types which isn't that good
